[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)
                                   
#2-4 Question:
                                   
*Exercise 2.4 Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies
are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the
difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in
pregnancy length?  *                                 

# 2-4 Solution:
                                   

firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean(), others.totalwgt_lb.mean()
                                   
                                   
CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)
